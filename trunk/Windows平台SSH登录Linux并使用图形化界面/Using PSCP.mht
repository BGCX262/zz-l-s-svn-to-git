transfer files securely</H1>
<P><A name=3Di1></A>PSCP, the PuTTY Secure Copy client, is a tool for <A =

name=3Di2></A>transferring files securely between computers using an SSH =

connection. </P>
<P>If you have an SSH-2 server, you might prefer PSFTP (see <A=20
href=3D"http://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/0.61/htmldoc/Chapter6.html#ps=

6</A>) for interactive use. PSFTP does not in general work with SSH-1 =
servers,=20
however. </P>
<H2><A name=3Dpscp-starting></A><A name=3DS5.1></A>5.1 Starting =
PSCP</H2>
<P>PSCP is a command line application. This means that you cannot just=20
double-click on its icon to run it and instead you have to bring up a <A =

name=3Di3></A>console window. With Windows 95, 98, and ME, this is =
called an=20
=E2=80=98MS-DOS Prompt=E2=80=99 and with Windows NT, 2000, and XP, it is =
called a =E2=80=98Command=20
Prompt=E2=80=99. It should be available from the Programs section of =
your <A=20
name=3Di4></A>Start Menu. </P>
<P>To start PSCP it will need either to be on your <A=20
name=3Di5></A><CODE>PATH</CODE> or in your current directory. To add the =
directory=20
containing PSCP to your <CODE>PATH</CODE> environment variable, type =
into the=20
console window: </P><PRE><CODE>set =
PATH=3DC:\path\to\putty\directory;%PATH%
</CODE></PRE>
<P>This will only work for the lifetime of that particular console =
window. To=20
set your <CODE>PATH</CODE> more permanently on Windows NT, 2000, and XP, =
use the=20
Environment tab of the System Control Panel. On Windows 95, 98, and ME, =
you will=20
need to edit your <A name=3Di6></A><CODE>AUTOEXEC.BAT</CODE> to include =
a=20
<CODE>set</CODE> command like the one above. </P>
<H2><A name=3Dpscp-usage></A><A name=3DS5.2></A>5.2 PSCP Usage</H2>
<P>Once you've got a console window to type into, you can just type=20
<CODE>pscp</CODE> on its own to bring up a usage message. This tells you =
the=20
version of PSCP you're using, and gives you a brief summary of how to =
use PSCP:=20

<P>(PSCP's interface is much like the Unix <CODE>scp</CODE> command, if =
you're=20
familiar with that.) </P>
<H3><A name=3Dpscp-usage-basics></A><A name=3DS5.2.1></A>5.2.1 The =
basics</H3>
<P>To <A name=3Di7></A>receive (a) file(s) from a remote server: =
</P><PRE><CODE>pscp [options] [user@]host:source target
</CODE></PRE>
<P>So to copy the file <CODE>/etc/hosts</CODE> from the server=20
<CODE>example.com</CODE> as user <CODE>fred</CODE> to the file=20
<CODE>c:\temp\example-hosts.txt</CODE>, you would type: =
</P><PRE><CODE>pscp fred@example.com:/etc/hosts =
c:\temp\example-hosts.txt
</CODE></PRE>
<P>To <A name=3Di8></A>send (a) file(s) to a remote server: =
</P><PRE><CODE>pscp [options] source [source...] [user@]host:target
</CODE></PRE>
<P>So to copy the local file <CODE>c:\documents\foo.txt</CODE> to the =
server=20
<CODE>example.com</CODE> as user <CODE>fred</CODE> to the file=20
<CODE>/tmp/foo</CODE> you would type: </P><PRE><CODE>pscp =
c:\documents\foo.txt fred@example.com:/tmp/foo
</CODE></PRE>
<P>You can use <A name=3Di9></A>wildcards to transfer multiple files in =
either=20
direction, like this: </P><PRE><CODE>pscp c:\documents\*.doc =
fred@example.com:docfiles
pscp fred@example.com:source/*.c c:\source
</CODE></PRE>
<P>However, in the second case (using a wildcard for multiple remote =
files) you=20
may see a warning saying something like =E2=80=98warning: remote host =
tried to write to=20
a file called =E2=80=98<CODE>terminal.c</CODE>=E2=80=99 when we =
requested a file called=20
=E2=80=98<CODE>*.c</CODE>=E2=80=99. If this is a wildcard, consider =
upgrading to SSH-2 or using=20
the =E2=80=98<CODE>-unsafe</CODE>=E2=80=99 option. Renaming of this file =
has been disallowed=E2=80=99.=20
</P>
<P>This is due to a <A name=3Di10></A>fundamental insecurity in the =
old-style <A=20
name=3Di11></A>SCP protocol: the client sends the wildcard string=20
(<CODE>*.c</CODE>) to the server, and the server sends back a sequence =
of file=20
names that match the wildcard pattern. However, there is nothing to stop =
the=20
server sending back a <EM>different</EM> pattern and writing over one of =
your=20
other files: if you request <CODE>*.c</CODE>, the server might send back =
the=20
file name <CODE>AUTOEXEC.BAT</CODE> and install a virus for you. Since =
the=20
wildcard matching rules are decided by the server, the client cannot =
reliably=20
verify that the filenames sent back match the pattern. </P>
<P>PSCP will attempt to use the newer <A name=3Di12></A>SFTP protocol =
(part of=20
SSH-2) where possible, which does not suffer from this security flaw. If =
you are=20
talking to an SSH-2 server which supports SFTP, you will never see this =
warning.=20
(You can force use of the SFTP protocol, if available, with =
<CODE>-sftp</CODE> -=20
see <A=20
href=3D"http://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/0.61/htmldoc/Chapter5.html#ps=
cp-usage-options-backend">section=20
5.2.2.6</A>.) </P>
<P>If you really need to use a server-side wildcard with an SSH-1 =
server, you=20
can use the <A name=3Di13></A><CODE>-unsafe</CODE> command line option =
with PSCP:=20
</P><PRE><CODE>pscp -unsafe fred@example.com:source/*.c c:\source
</CODE></PRE>
<P>This will suppress the warning message and the file transfer will =
happen.=20
However, you should be aware that by using this option you are giving =
the server=20
the ability to write to <EM>any</EM> file in the target directory, so =
you should=20
only use this option if you trust the server administrator not to be =
malicious=20
(and not to let the server machine be cracked by malicious people).=20
Alternatively, do any such download in a newly created empty directory. =
(Even in=20
=E2=80=98unsafe=E2=80=99 mode, PSCP will still protect you against the =
server trying to get out=20
of that directory using pathnames including =
=E2=80=98<CODE>..</CODE>=E2=80=99.) </P>

<P>The <A name=3Di14></A>login name on the remote server. If this is =
omitted, and=20

<CODE>source</CODE></H4>
<P>One or more source files. <A name=3Di16></A>Wildcards are allowed. =
The syntax=20
of wildcards depends on the system to which they apply, so if you are =
copying=20
<EM>from</EM> a Windows system <EM>to</EM> a UNIX system, you should use =
Windows=20
wildcard syntax (e.g. <CODE>*.*</CODE>), but if you are copying =
<EM>from</EM> a=20
UNIX system <EM>to</EM> a Windows system, you would use the wildcard =
syntax=20
allowed by your UNIX shell (e.g. <CODE>*</CODE>). </P>
<P>If the source is a remote server and you do not specify a full =
pathname (in=20
UNIX, a pathname beginning with a <CODE>/</CODE> (slash) character), =
what you=20
specify as a source will be interpreted relative to your <A =

<P>The filename or directory to put the file(s). When copying from a =
remote=20
server to a local host, you may wish simply to place the file(s) in the =
current=20

For=20
example: </P><PRE><CODE>pscp fred@example.com:/home/tom/.emacs .

<P>...would copy <CODE>/home/tom/.emacs</CODE> on the remote server to =

<P>As with the <CODE>source</CODE> parameter, if the target is on a =

Options</H3>
<P>PSCP accepts all the general command line options supported by the =
PuTTY=20
tools, except the ones which make no sense in a file transfer utility. =
See <A=20
href=3D"http://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/0.61/htmldoc/Chapter3.html#us=
ing-general-opts">section=20
3.8.3</A> for a description of these options. (The ones not supported by =
PSCP=20
are clearly marked.) </P>
<P>PSCP also supports some of its own options. The following sections =
describe=20
PSCP's specific command-line options. </P>
<H4><A name=3Dpscp-usage-options-ls></A><A name=3DS5.2.2.1></A>5.2.2.1 =
<A=20
name=3Di18></A><CODE>-ls</CODE> <A name=3Di19></A>list remote files</H4>
<P>If the <CODE>-ls</CODE> option is given, no files are transferred; =
instead,=20
remote files are listed. Only a hostname specification and optional =
remote file=20
specification need be given. For example: </P><PRE><CODE>pscp -ls =
fred@example.com:dir1
</CODE></PRE>
<P>The SCP protocol does not contain within itself a means of listing =
files. If=20
SCP is in use, this option therefore assumes that the server responds=20
appropriately to the command <CODE>ls&nbsp;-la</CODE>; this may not work =
with=20
all servers. </P>
<P>If SFTP is in use, this option should work with all servers. </P>

<P>By default, files copied with PSCP are <A name=3Di22></A>timestamped =

ETA: 00:00:13 |  13%
</CODE></PRE>
<P>The fields in this display are (from left to right), filename, size =
(in=20
kilobytes) of file transferred so far, estimate of how fast the file is =
being=20
transferred (in kilobytes per second), estimated time that the transfer =
will be=20
complete, and percentage of the file so far transferred. The =
<CODE>-q</CODE>=20
option to PSCP suppresses the printing of these statistics. </P>

<P>By default, PSCP will only copy files. Any directories you specify to =
copy=20
will be skipped, as will their contents. The <CODE>-r</CODE> option =
tells PSCP=20
to descend into any directories you specify, and to copy them and their=20
contents. This allows you to use PSCP to transfer whole directory =

between machines. </P>
<H4><A name=3Dpscp-usage-options-batch></A><A =

<P>If you use the <CODE>-batch</CODE> option, PSCP will never give an=20
interactive prompt while establishing the connection. If the server's =
host key=20
is invalid, for example (see <A=20
href=3D"http://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/0.61/htmldoc/Chapter2.html#gs=
-hostkey">section=20
2.2</A>), then the connection will simply be abandoned instead of asking =
you=20
what to do next. </P>
<P>This may help PSCP's behaviour when it is used in automated scripts: =
using=20
<CODE>-batch</CODE>, if something goes wrong at connection time, the =

force use of=20
particular protocol</H4>
<P>As mentioned in <A=20
href=3D"http://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/0.61/htmldoc/Chapter5.html#ps=
cp-usage-basics">section=20
5.2.1</A>, there are two different file transfer protocols in use with =
SSH.=20
Despite its name, PSCP (like many other ostensible <CODE>scp</CODE> =
clients) can=20
use either of these protocols. </P>
<P>The older <A name=3Di30></A>SCP protocol does not have a written =
specification=20
and leaves a lot of detail to the server platform. <A =
name=3Di31></A>Wildcards are=20
expanded on the server. The simple design means that any wildcard =
specification=20
supported by the server platform (such as brace expansion) can be used, =
but also=20
leads to interoperability issues such as with filename quoting (for =
instance,=20
where filenames contain spaces), and also the security issue described =
in <A=20
href=3D"http://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/0.61/htmldoc/Chapter5.html#ps=
cp-usage-basics">section=20
5.2.1</A>. </P>
<P>The newer <A name=3Di32></A>SFTP protocol, which is usually =
associated with=20
SSH-2 servers, is specified in a more platform independent way, and =
leaves=20
issues such as wildcard syntax up to the client. (PuTTY's SFTP wildcard =
syntax=20
is described in <A=20
href=3D"http://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/0.61/htmldoc/Chapter6.html#ps=
ftp-wildcards">section=20
6.2.2</A>.) This makes it more consistent across platforms, more =
suitable for=20
scripting and automation, and avoids security issues with wildcard =
matching.=20
</P>
<P>Normally PSCP will attempt to use the SFTP protocol, and only fall =
back to=20
the SCP protocol if SFTP is not available on the server. </P>
<P>The <CODE>-scp</CODE> option forces PSCP to use the SCP protocol or =
quit.=20
</P>
<P>The <CODE>-sftp</CODE> option forces PSCP to use the SFTP protocol or =
quit.=20
When this option is specified, PSCP looks harder for an SFTP server, =
which may=20
allow use of SFTP with SSH-1 depending on server setup. </P>
<H3><A name=3Dpscp-retval></A><A name=3DS5.2.3></A>5.2.3 <A =
name=3Di33></A>Return=20
value</H3>
<P>PSCP returns an <A name=3Di34></A><CODE>ERRORLEVEL</CODE> of zero =
(success)=20
only if the files were correctly transferred. You can test for this in a =
<A=20
name=3Di35></A>batch file, using code such as this: </P><PRE><CODE>pscp =
file*.* user@hostname:
if errorlevel 1 echo There was an error
</CODE></PRE>
<H3><A name=3Dpscp-pubkey></A><A name=3DS5.2.4></A>5.2.4 Using <A=20
name=3Di36></A>public key authentication with PSCP</H3>
<P>Like PuTTY, PSCP can authenticate using a public key instead of a =
password.=20
There are three ways you can do this. </P>
<P>Firstly, PSCP can use PuTTY saved sessions in place of hostnames (see =
<A=20
href=3D"http://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/0.61/htmldoc/Chapter5.html#ps=
cp-usage-basics-host">section=20
5.2.1.2</A>). So you would do this: </P>
<UL>
  <LI>Run PuTTY, and create a PuTTY saved session (see <A=20
  =
href=3D"http://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/0.61/htmldoc/Chapter4.html#co=
nfig-saving">section=20
  4.1.2</A>) which specifies your private key file (see <A=20
  =
href=3D"http://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/0.61/htmldoc/Chapter4.html#co=
nfig-ssh-privkey">section=20
  4.20.8</A>). You will probably also want to specify a username to log =
in as=20
  (see <A=20
  =
href=3D"http://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/0.61/htmldoc/Chapter4.html#co=
nfig-username">section=20
  4.14.1</A>).=20
  <LI>In PSCP, you can now use the name of the session instead of a =
hostname:=20
  type <CODE>pscp sessionname:file localfile</CODE>, where=20
  <CODE>sessionname</CODE> is replaced by the name of your saved =
session.=20
</LI></UL>
<P>Secondly, you can supply the name of a private key file on the =
command line,=20

<UL>
  <LI>Ensure Pageant is running, and has your private key stored in it.=20
