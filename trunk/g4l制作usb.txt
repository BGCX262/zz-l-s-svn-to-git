- download G4L ISO from http://sourceforge.net/projects/g4l
- download latest syslinux-X.XX.zip from http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/boot/syslinux/

- insert your usb stick
- make a directory "boot" on the usb stick

- extract all the files from downloaded G4L ISO and place them into the "boot" directory on the usb stick:
--- windows user can d/l and use http://www.magiciso.com/ to do this
--- linux users simply mount the iso using mount -o loop g4l-v0.27.iso iso and cp the files over
- in the "boot" directory delete syslinux.cfg
- in the "boot" directory rename isolinux.cfg to syslinux.cfg
- from the "boot" directory copy syslinux.cfg to the root of the usb stick (F: or /)
- edit syslinux.cfg in the root directory, you now need to add "boot/" before each line that points to a file:
--- DEFAULT vesamenu.c32 to DEFAULT boot/vesamenu.c32
--- MENU BACKGROUND test.png to MENU BACKGROUND boot/test.png
--- KERNEL bzImage6 to KERNEL boot/bzImage6
--- APPEND initrd=ramdisk.gz.... to APPEND initrd=boot/ramdisk.gz....
------- do this for all KERNEL lines and all APPEND lines just add boot/ dont change what is there already, till you reach the last line
--- ONTIMEOUT bz26.5 and change that to ONTIMEOUT boot/bz26.5

- extract the syslinux-X.XX.zip you downloaded
- windows users go into  the win32 directory of the extracted file
--- do syslinux.exe -m -a -d /boot F:
- linux users go into the linux directory of the extraced file

--- do ./syslinux /dev/sdd1
